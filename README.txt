The idea of this project is To apply word embeddings for text classification, use 1D convolutions as feature extractors in natural language processing (NLP), and perform binary text classification using deep learning. 
The dataset I worked on classifying a large number of Wikipedia comments as being either toxic or not (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). 
This issue is especially imtortant, given the conversations the global community and tech companies are having on content moderation, online harassment, and inclusivity. 
The data set we will use comes from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle.
